# Sargasso

My implementation of Fly.io's distributed systems challenges: [Gossip Glommers].

## Why's it called that?

I was inspired by the test framework's name (Maelstrom) to name my solutions
after an interesting body of water (maybe a calming one?). Apparently, the
[Sargasso Sea] is unique in having no land boundaries. That's really cool!
